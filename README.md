# Knowledge

Various web development skills that I'd like to review on a regular basis, including programming languages, frameworks, libraries, databases, tools, and more theoretical stuff like mathematics, algorithms, data structures, software architecture, and so on.

The main goal for me is to constantly learn more advanced knowledge in order to become a senior web developer as soon as possible and to constantly reach a higher level of expertise in a wide range of subjects.
